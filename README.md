Problem #1

Given a binary string s, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.


Example 1:

Input: s = "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.

Example 2:

Input: s = "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.











Problem #2

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer k.

First, convert s into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., replace 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26). Then, transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits. Repeat the transform operation k times in total.

For example, if s = "zbax" and k = 2, then the resulting integer would be 8 by the following operations:

    Convert: "zbax" ➝ "(26)(2)(1)(24)" ➝ "262124" ➝ 262124
    Transform #1: 262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17
    Transform #2: 17 ➝ 1 + 7 ➝ 8

Return the resulting integer after performing the operations described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "iiii", k = 1
Output: 36
Explanation: The operations are as follows:
- Convert: "iiii" ➝ "(9)(9)(9)(9)" ➝ "9999" ➝ 9999
- Transform #1: 9999 ➝ 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 ➝ 36
Thus the resulting integer is 36.

Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode", k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The operations are as follows:
- Convert: "leetcode" ➝ "(12)(5)(5)(20)(3)(15)(4)(5)" ➝ "12552031545" ➝ 12552031545
- Transform #1: 12552031545 ➝ 1 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 5 ➝ 33
- Transform #2: 33 ➝ 3 + 3 ➝ 6
Thus the resulting integer is 6.
